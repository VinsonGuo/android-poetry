/**
 * Base class of LitePal to make things easier when developers need to use
 * context. When you need context, just use
 * <b>LitePalApplication.getContext()</b>. To make this function work, you need
 * to configure your AndroidManifest.xml. Specifying
 * <b>"org.litepal.LitePalApplication"</b> as the application name in your
 * &lt;application&gt; tag to enable LitePal get the context. Of course if you
 * need to write your own Application class, LitePal can still live with that.
 * But just remember make your own Application class inherited from
 * LitePalApplication instead of inheriting from Application directly. This can
 * make all things work without side effects. <br>
 * Besides if you don't want use the above way, you can also call the LitePal.initialize(Context)
 * method to do the same job. Just remember call this method as early as possible, in Application's onCreate()
 * method will be fine.
